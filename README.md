# GoodSleepQuality
Leverage this sleep data to analyze the relationship between lifestyle, health, demographic factors, and sleep quality. Your goal is to identify factors that correlate with poor sleep health.

Some examples:

- Examine relationships between several factors like gender, occupation, physical activity, stress levels, and sleep quality/duration. Create visualizations to present your findings.
- Produce recommendations on ways people can improve sleep health based on the patterns in the data.
- Develop an accessible summary of study findings and recommendations for improving sleep health for non-technical audiences.
